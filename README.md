# Movie Database Management System (MDMS)

## Overview
The Movie Database program is designed to manage a collection of movies, allowing users to add movies to a wishlist, search, and sort movies in various ways. It provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction with the database.

## Setup
To set up the program, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.

## Starting the Program
To start the program, compile the Java files and then run the Main class. Use the following commands in your terminal:
```
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Testing the Program
The program comes with a suite of tests for the `Movie`, `MovieDatabase`, and `User` classes. To run the tests, compile the test classes along with the classes they are testing, and then execute the test classes. For example:
```
javac UserTest.java MovieDatabaseTest.java
java MovieDatabaseTest
```

Replace `MovieDatabaseTest` with `UserTest` to run the respective tests.

## Using the Program
After starting the program, the user interface will guide you through creating a wishlist, adding movies, and performing searches and other operations on the movie database.
