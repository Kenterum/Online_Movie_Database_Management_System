# Movie Database Management System (MDMS)

## Overview
The Movie Database program is designed to manage a collection of movies, allowing users to add movies to a wishlist, search, and sort movies in various ways. It provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction with the database.

## Setup
To set up the program, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.

## Starting the Program
To start the program, compile the Java files and then run the Main class. Use the following commands in your terminal:
```
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Testing the Program
The program comes with a suite of tests for the `Movie`, `MovieDatabase`, and `User` classes. To run the tests, compile the test classes along with the classes they are testing, and then execute the test classes. For example:

javac Movie.java MovieTest.java
java MovieTest
```

Replace `MovieTest` with `UserTest` or `MovieDatabaseTest` to run the respective tests.

## Using the Program
